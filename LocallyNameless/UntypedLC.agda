{- A formalization of some notions from the untyped lambda calculus.

  The main goal is to check how will the locally nameless approach (de Bruijn indices for
  bound variables and names for free variables) work in practice for me.
  
  If it proves to be useful then this work will get extended to formalize the Simply Typed Lambda Calcules.
